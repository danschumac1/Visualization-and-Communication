**Important**

If you haven't installed `tidyverse` package before, do this:

Install `tidyverse` package by running the following command in the console. This needs to be done only once so make sure that you don't run it from your Rmarkdown code chunk.

install.packages("tidyverse")

Once the installation is complete, load the library

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
```

We will also use a utility library called `here` which helps us locating files in the project folder. Locating files is not an issue when your project directory has no subdirectories. However, that's unlikely. For example, in my case, I stored the data files in a subdirectory called "Data". `here` package makes it easy to reference that subdirectory and the dataset stored within.

Install `here` package by running `install.packages("here")` from your console.

## Data manipulation

Read the zipped CSV file. Note how I have labeled the code chunk as "data-read". This way I can later easily reference the code chunk if required.

```{r}
dt = read_csv('C:/Users/dansc/Documents/Gradschool/Visualization and Communication/data/tech_stocks_csv.zip.zip')
```

```{r}
dt
```

```{r data-read}

dt = read_csv(here::here("data", "tech_stocks_csv.zip"),
              show_col_types = FALSE) # I add this argument to silent the output

```

### Frequency distribution

```{r}
count(dt, fyear)
count(dt, conm)
count(dt, fyear, conm)
#another way to get same result
select(
  filter(dt,fyear == 2009 | fyear == 2023),
  fyear, conm
  )
```

### Select columns

Use `select()` function from `dplyr` package to select columns

In the following example, we will select a handful of columns and then save the resulting dataframe into `dt1`

```{r}
dt1 = dplyr::select(.data = dt, conm, fyear, sale)
```

Print dt1

```{r}
dt1
#sales is in millions of dollars
```

### Creating a new variable

`mutate()` function from `dplyr` allows you to create new variables

The variable `sale` is in million USD. Let's create a new variable `sale_bil` which stores sales in billion USD.

```{r}
mutate(dt1, sale_bil = round(sale / 1000), 0)
```

Create multiple variables

```{r}
mutate(dt1,
       sale_bil = sale / 1000,
       
       # metrics for conectrations 
       # if minority population because majority you don't have diversity
       # entropy ab info content in data
       # if every student was Indian, not diverse (no variation)
       # the more variation, the more diversity
       # squared values and add together to calculate proportion???
       sale_sq = round(sale_bil^2, 2), # Create square of sales and round it to 2 decimals
       # use log when come across high numbers, and you have a wide range.
       # wealth of individuals. 
       log_sale = log(sale))
```

### Summarize data

`summarize()` function from `dplyr` helps in getting summaries as a dataframe.

Use `dt` to get averages of sales, total assets, profits, and advertising

```{r}
summary(dt1) #not a df because length of cols isn't identical
class(summary(dt1)) # it is a table.

# psych package has a function that allows us to get different summary statistics.
# but if you want total control, you should use summarize.
```

```{r}

summarize(dt,
          sale_mean = mean(sale),
          #total assest
          at_mean = mean(at),
          #profits operating income before depreciation
          oibdp_mean = mean(oibdp),
          #advertising expense
          xad_mean = mean(xad, na.rm = T))

```

```{r}
select(dt, xad)
```

We get a missing value in return for `xad_mean`. This is because by default `mean()` requires non-missing values. We can remove the `NA` from `xad` before taking the mean by using `na.rm` argument inside `mean()`

```{r}

summarize(dt,
          sale_mean = mean(sale),
          at_mean = mean(at),
          oibdp_mean = mean(oibdp),
          xad_mean = mean(xad, na.rm = TRUE),
          sale_sd = sd(sale)) #standard  deviation of sale)

```

### Summaries by groups.

Next, We want to find the averages of the above variables for each company separately. For this we can use `group_by()` function from `dplyr`

```{r}
summarize(
  group_by(dt, conm), # Note how I used group_by
    sale_mean = mean(sale),
    at_mean = mean(at),
    oibdp_mean = mean(oibdp),
    xad_mean = mean(xad, na.rm = TRUE))
summarize(
  .by = 
)
```

## Pipes

This is where I would like to introduce the concept of pipes. Consider two steps to create a subset of `dt`.

```{r}
dt1 = select(dt, conm, fyear, sale)
dt2 = filter(dt1, sale > 100000)

#another way to write it. 
dt2 = filter(
  dt1 = select(dt, conm, fyear, sale),
  sale > 100000
)

#another way without nesting



```

These two steps can be combined into one step. Can you think of any reasons for why this is useful?

```{r}
dt1 = dt %>% select(.data = ., conm, fyear, sale)
```

```{r}
c('A','B','C') %>% class()
```

```{r}
lm(function = sale ~ at + cogs)

# data is the second arg of lm. So this doesn't work!
dt %>%  lm(sale ~ at +cogs)
# instead. COOL
dt %>% lm(sale ~ at + cogs, data = .)
```

From https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3410/pipe

*A pipe is a method used to pass information from one program process to another. Unlike other types of interprocess communication, a pipe only offers one-way communication by passing a parameter or output from one process to another. The information that is passed through the pipe is held by the system until it can be read by the receiving process. Pipes are primarily used in programming on Unix systems.*

We will use `%>%` to pipe output data from one `tidyverse` function to the next. This pipe originates from `magrittr` package. Read more about it here: https://magrittr.tidyverse.org/reference/pipe.html

The keyboard shortcut is

Shift + Command + M (Mac) Shift + Control + M (Windows)

As an example, we will select a few variables and then pass them on to summarize using a pipe

```{r}
dt %>% 
  select(.data = ., 
         conm, fyear, sale, at, oibdp, xad) %>% 
  summarize(.data = .,
            sale_mean = mean(sale),
            at_mean = mean(at),
            oibdp_mean = mean(oibdp),
            xad_mean = mean(xad, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Can you create grouped means for each company?

```{r}
dt %>% 
  select(.data = ., 
         conm, fyear, sale, at, oibdp, xad) %>% 
  group_by(.data = ., conm) %>% 
  summarize(.data = .,
            sale_mean = mean(sale),
            at_mean = mean(at),
            oibdp_mean = mean(oibdp),
            xad_mean = mean(xad, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r}
#same as above but...
#speed up your code, a little more confusing

dt %>% 
  select(conm, fyear, sale, at, oibdp, xad) %>% 
  group_by(conm) %>% 
  summarize(across(
    # lambda function
    c(sale, at, oibdp, xad), \(x) mean(x, na.rm=T)
    )
    )
```

### Joining dataframes

`dplyr` provides several `_join` functions inspired by SQL.

```{r echo=FALSE}
# file does not exist
# knitr::include_graphics("joins.png")
```

We will create summary of sales by fyear and join it to dt1

```{r}
dt1_summary = dt1 %>% 
  group_by(fyear) %>% 
  summarize(sale_mean = mean(sale))
```

```{r}
(dt1_summary_filtered = dt1_summary %>% 
  filter(fyear > 2009 & fyear <2023))
```

```{r}
(dt2 = inner_join(dt1, dt1_summary, by = 'fyear'))
```

```{r}
(dt3 = inner_join(dt1, dt1_summary_filtered, by = 'fyear'))
```

```{r}
#mean anual sales
dt1_summary
```

```{r}
dt2 = inner_join(dt1, dt1_summary, by = "fyear")
```

```{r}
dt2
```

```{r}
dt1 %>% 
  group_by(fyear) %>% 
  mutate(sale_mean = mean(sale),
         
         #scales package allows you to format your vars
         #in this case format as percent
         sale_ratio = scales::percent(sale / sale_mean,
                                      accuracy = 0.01),
         
         #in this case as dollars.
         sale = scales::dollar(sale),
         sale_mean = scales::dollar(sale_mean))
```
